## The Data

In this lab we're going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in
California. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).

The data come to us from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

```

**1. Briefly describe the dataset (~ 4 sentences). What information does it contain?**

In this lab weâ€™re going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in California.

The childcare_costs data set looks at various counties and provides information on
unemployment rates, labor force participation rates, poverty rates, medium earnings/
income, total population count, race, number of households, employment/ type of jobs, 
and childcare care rates for different groups. The counties data set looks at various 
counties and provides information on their name, state, and two letter abbreviation. 

Together, these data sets allow us to analyze and compare counties in terms of 
employment, poverty, household income, and childcare costs, offering insights into 
the economic factors that may influence childcare affordability across different 
regions. So, they help analyze the relationship between childcare costs 
and various socioeconomic factors across U.S. counties.The data came from market 
rate surveys and the American Community Survey (ACS) and was collected to 
understand childcare affordability and access, to support families and make 
changes in needed

## California Childcare Costs

Let's start by focusing only on California. 

**2. Create a `ca_childcare` dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the `childcare_costs` dataset.** 
*Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.*

```{r}
#| label: ca-childcare-costs
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ca_childcare <- childcare_costs |>
  inner_join(counties, by = "county_fips_code") |>
  filter(state_abbreviation == "CA")

ca_childcare

```

**3. Using a function from the `forcats` package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the [10 Census regions](https://census.ca.gov/regions/) in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.**  
*Hint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!*

```{r}
#| label: recoding-county-to-census-regions
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ca_childcare <- ca_childcare |> # keep
  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, " County")) |> # keep
  mutate(region = 
    fct_collapse(county_name,
      "Superior California" = c("Butte", "Colusa", "El Dorado", "Glenn", "Lassen", "Modoc", 
      "Nevada", "Placer", "Plumas", "Sacramento", "Shasta", "Sierra", "Siskiyou", "Sutter", 
      "Tehama", "Yolo", "Yuba"), "North Coast" = c("Del Norte", "Humboldt", "Lake", "Mendocino",
      "Napa", "Sonoma", "Trinity"), "San Francisco Bay Area" = c("Alameda", "Contra Costa", 
      "Marin", "San Francisco", "San Mateo", "Santa Clara", "Solano"), "Northeren San Joaquin 
       Valley" = c("Alpine", "Amador", "Calaveras", "Madera", "Mariposa", "Merced", "Mono", "San
       Joaquin", "Stanislaus", "Tuolumne"), "Central Coast" = c("Monterey", "San Benito", "San
       Luis Obispo", "Santa Barbara", "Santa Cruz", "Ventura"), "Southern San Joaquin Valley" = 
       c("Fresno", "Inyo", "Kern", "Kings", "Tulare"), "Inland Empire" = c("Riverside", "San 
       Bernardino"), "Los Angeles County" = c("Los Angeles"), "Orange County" = c("Orange"),
       "San-Diego Imperial" = c("Imperial", "San Diego")))
  
 ca_childcare

```


**4. Let's consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the `median` of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the `region` and the `study_year`. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.**

```{r}
#| label: median-income-by-region-over-time
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# https://chatgpt.com/share/670f5a38-d3b4-8006-ad62-8769382ddacb
# got a red error from rstudio -- asked what it means -- added .groups = 'drop'

ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year == 2008 | study_year == 2018) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarise(median_income = median(mhi_2018, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = region,
              names_from = study_year, 
              values_from = median_income, 
              names_prefix = "Income ") |>
  arrange(`Income 2018`)


```


**5. Which California `region` had the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this `region` correspond to the `region` with the lowest `median` income in 2018 that you found in Q4?**  
*Hint: The code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.*

The region with the lowest medium full-time median weekly price for center-based 
childcare for infants in 2018 is Superior California, and in the previous datatset the 
second to lowest group was Superior California (lowest is Southern San Joaquin Valley).

```{r}
#| label: lowest-median-weekly-price-2018
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

 ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year == 2018) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarise(med_price = median(mc_infant, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(med_price == min(med_price))  

```

**6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.**

## Median Household Income vs. Childcare Costs for Infants

**7. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) and the full-time median weekly price charged for center-based childcare for an infant in California. Overlay a linear regression line (lm) to show the trend.**

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot-median-income-vs-childcare-cost
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(ca_childcare, aes(x = mhi_2018, y = mc_infant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "steelblue") + 
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Household Income 
    and Center-Based Childcare Costs in California",
    y = "",
    x = "2018 Dollars",
    subtitle = "Median Weekly Price for Infants"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()  

```

**8. Look up the documentation for `lm()` and fit a linear regression model to the relationship shown in your plot above.**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# complete the code provided

reg_mod1 <- lm(mc_infant ~ mhi_2018, data = ca_childcare)
summary(reg_mod1)

```

**9. Using the output from `summary()`, write out the estimated regression line (recall: $y = mx + b$).**

y = (2.241e-03)x + 1.317e+02

**10. Do you have evidence to conclude there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California? Cite values from your `summary()` output to support your claim!**

Yes. The slope is positive, so if the average income a household makes increases, 
the weekly cost of infant childcare also increases. More specifically, the slope is 
2.241e-03, meaning that for every dollar a household makes, the weekly cost of 
infant goes up by about $0.002241. Next, the p-value is < 2.2e-16, which is
smaller than 0.05, which further proves that statistically there is a relationship
Between  childcare prices and income. The t-value for the mhi_2018 coefficient is 33.26
(t-value for slope), which is large, suggesting the slope is far from 0, or that
again household income does have an impact on childcare cost. Lastly, the R-squared
value is 0.635, so 63.5% of the childcare cost variability is a result from 
income.
